# Plotting

Python visualisation (particularly using Matplotlib) talk given to students in the [ESPRC CDT in Data Science](http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk/), as
part of the fortnightly CDTea & Biscuits meetings.

We cover basic plots, histograms, subplots, using the object oriented API, styles, and other Python libraries useful for visualisation.

# Requirements

- Matplotlib
- numpy

For some of it:

- scikit-learn

(although the figures produced are .png files in the github repo)

Not really required but useful for doing the last part where we go beyond Matplotlib:

- bokeh
- plotly
